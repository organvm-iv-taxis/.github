# Contributing to ORGAN-IV: Orchestration (Taxis)

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the organvm system.

## Code of Conduct

All participants are governed by our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## How to Contribute

### Scope

This organization covers: Governance workflows, registry updates, dependency validation.

### Getting Started

1. **Fork** the target repository
2. **Create a branch** (`feature/your-feature` or `fix/your-fix`)
3. **Follow existing code style** — check each repo's README for stack details
4. **Write tests** — maintain or improve coverage
5. **Submit a PR** with clear description of changes

### What We Accept

- Bug fixes with tests
- Documentation improvements
- Performance optimizations
- Security patches (see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md))
- Feature proposals via Issues (discuss before implementing)

### What Requires Discussion First

- Changes to governance rules, registry schema modifications, workflow trigger changes, promotion criteria updates

## Licensing

Governance rule changes require a proposal issue with rationale before implementation. Registry schema changes must be validated against existing data.

## Development Standards

- TypeScript: strict mode, named exports, async/await
- Python: PEP 8, type hints, f-strings
- Tests required for all new functionality
- Commit messages: imperative mood, <72 chars title

## Getting Help

- Open an Issue for questions
- Check existing documentation in each repo's README
